## Follow-up Scripts

### Version A - Group Session Invitation

Hi [Name],

I wanted to share some thoughts about your assessment results. Your score places you at what I call the "[Score Range]" level, which is actually a wonderful place to be right now.

What's particularly interesting, _[Name]_, is that this score reflects your current stage of mind-body integration. I _know_ you can experience deeper connection within just 10-14 days of focused practice. I've seen this happen so many times with people exactly where you are now.

And you know, what most people at your level discover is that their awareness naturally deepens as they explore the practices that match their score.

I remember working with someone very similar to you. Sarah, who started at the same level as you, noticed her stress levels decreasing within just two weeks of starting the basic practices. She described feeling "more at home in her body" than she had in years.

[Name], I'd love to share something with you - it's my FREE Progress Tracker that's really helped people at your level notice the subtle shifts as they develop.

I'm getting together with a small group this Thursday to share the exact practices I've found work best for people with your score. It's just a casual conversation where I'll walk through three approaches that can help deepen your connection. If you'd like to join us, I've saved you a spot. Just let me know and I'll send you all the details.

Looking forward to supporting your journey, [Name].

Warmly,
Coach Pamela
